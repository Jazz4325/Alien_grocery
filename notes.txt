Item Class:
    -weight attribute (can you pick it up? / overincumberance)
    -size - does it fit in the converter? otherwise you need to break it down into smaller pieces

NPCs:
    -how invested is the customer in caring?
    -escalate situation depending on what they see/encounter
    -customer/staff/cops/A51

-consume() / use() in player Class
-if we want to sprinkle in unique per-item actions, we can add them on to the consume() method in player with conditionals.
-if this gets too long / we realize we want more per-item complexity, consider a custom eat method for each item (time consuming! but bespoke)
